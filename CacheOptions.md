# Caching 

- Using caching technique we can catch the output of complete web page or portion of a web page or any Orbitery information.<br/>
- It is recommended to apply caching technique on static web pages.<br/>
- Usually caching technique will improve the web application performance.
- A cache  stores the output generated by a page in the memory and this saved output (cache) will serve us (users) in the future.


Types of Caching:
   1) Output Caching
   2) Fragment Caching
   3) Data Caching <br/>
    
### 1) Output Caching

output caching is used to store complete output of a specific web page in the cache memory.<br/>
To cache an entire page's output we need to specify a directive at the top of our page, this directive is the @ OutputCache.<br/>

<%@ OutputCache Duration = 5 VaryByParam = "ID" %> <br/>
In case of caching a page, some pages can generate different content for different browsers. <br/>
In that scenario we need to add an additional attribute to our statement for overcoming the preceding problem.<br/>
<%@ OutputCache Duration = 5 VaryByParam = "None" VaryByCustom = "Browser" %>  


### 2) Fragment Caching 

Fragment caching is used to store Fragment portion of output of a specific web page in the cache memory.<br/>
